# RecipeSafe
<br/>
<p align="center">
RecipeSafe is an iOS application to store recipes from external websites and keep this in one location.  Simply open safari, find a recipe, and click share to RecipeSafe.  RecipeSafe downloads all important information from the site, and populates a corresponding page on the app.  Recipes are automatically saved and available offline, and can be edited by the user.  Users can also create their own recipe by adding in custom ingredients and instructions.
